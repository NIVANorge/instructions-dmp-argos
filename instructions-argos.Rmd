## What is Argos?

[Argos](https://argos.openaire.eu) is an online machine-actionable tool developed by [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/) to facilitate Research Data Management (RDM) 

## Why Argos?

-   Collection of dataset descriptions
-   Associated with an activity ("project" or "grant")
-   Can be versioned
-   Exportable to various forms
-   Machine readable (xml, json)
-   Human readable (pdf/openxml)
-   Can be assigned a DOI and published in Zenodo.

We recommend using Orcid ID because

- By linking your ORCID ID to your contributions on platforms like Argos or Zenodo, you enhance the visibility and credibility of your work. 


- Data Integration and Interoperability: ORCID IDs enable better integration and interoperability of research data across various systems and platforms. When you log in with your ORCID ID, it becomes easier for platforms like Argos or Zenodo to associate your contributions with your unique identifier.

- Tracking and Managing Contributions: Using your ORCID ID allows you to easily track and manage your contributions across different platforms. You can view your contributions in one place and ensure they are correctly attributed to you, helping you maintain an accurate record of your scholarly output.

- Compliance: Many funders and publishers require or encourage researchers to use ORCID IDs for their contributions.
